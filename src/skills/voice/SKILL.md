## Text-to-Speech (Voice Output)

Generate MP3 audio from text using the `metabot voice tts` CLI.

### Quick Commands

```bash
# Generate MP3, prints file path to stdout
metabot voice tts "Hello, this is a test"

# Generate and play immediately
metabot voice tts "Hello" --play

# Save to specific file
metabot voice tts "Hello" -o greeting.mp3

# Override provider and voice
metabot voice tts "Hello" --provider doubao --voice zh_female_wanqudashu_moon_bigtts

# Pipe text (useful for long content)
echo "Long text here" | metabot voice tts
echo "Long text" | metabot voice tts -o output.mp3
```

### When to Use

- User asks you to "say", "speak", "read aloud", or "generate audio/voice"
- User wants a voice recording or audio version of text
- User requests TTS (text-to-speech) output

### Guidelines

- For short text (greetings, alerts), use inline: `metabot voice tts "text"`
- For longer text, pipe through stdin: `echo "..." | metabot voice tts`
- The output file is MP3 format
- Use `--play` only when the user explicitly wants to hear the audio (it blocks until playback completes)
- When saving files for the user, use `-o` with a descriptive filename
- To send the audio to the user in Feishu, copy the file to the outputs directory:
  `cp /tmp/metabot-voice-xxx.mp3 /tmp/metabot-outputs/<chatId>/`
